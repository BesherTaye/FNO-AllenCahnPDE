# What are Partial Differential Equations?
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are mathematical equations that involve multiple independent variables, their partial derivatives, and an unknown function. They describe how a quantity changes with respect to several variables and are fundamental in modeling various physical, engineering, and natural phenomena, such as heat conduction, wave propagation, fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.

# Fourier-Neural-Operator
Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) are a deep learning approach for solving PDEs efficiently by learning function-to-function mappings. Unlike traditional numerical solvers, FNOs operate in the Fourier domain, making them significantly faster and more scalable for high-dimensional PDEs.

Traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as Finite Difference Methods (FDM), Finite Element Methods (FEM), and Spectral Methods, can be computationally expensive and struggle with high-dimensional or complex boundary conditions. Deep learning (DL) offers an alternative that can handle these challenges efficiently.

Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) outperform CNNs and PINNs in learning PDEs by capturing global dependencies through Fourier transforms, enabling faster convergence and superior scalability. Unlike CNNs, which struggle with long-range interactions, and PINNs, which require complex loss tuning, FNOs learn direct mappings between function spaces, making them highly efficient for high-dimensional problems. Their ability to generalize across varying conditions without retraining makes them ideal for real-time applications like fluid dynamics and climate modeling.

# Operator Learning
Operator learning is a machine learning approach used to learn mappings between functions rather than just input-output pairs. It generalizes neural networks to work with infinite-dimensional spaces, such as solutions to differential equations. 
It learns a transformation $G$ that maps one function to another:

$$G: u(x) \to v(x)$$

where $u(x)$ is the input function and $v(x)$ is the output function.



PDE solutions function as operators that map between function spaces, taking inputs like initial conditions, boundary conditions, and source terms to produce the corresponding solution.
